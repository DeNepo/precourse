Welcome to Hack Your Future Belgium. There is a lot of code, links, and browser tabs in your near future!

It'll take a little while to learn how to keep this all organized in your head and on your computer. If you're having trouble finding something, take a look through the links in your class repository. If you still cant find it, ask your classmates on Discord and someone will help you out!

This module's main objective is to get you comfortable with the workflows of programming and of Hack Your Future BE. The finished projects won't be complex or impressive to an outsider, but to complete them you will need to have a basic overview of the entire development process. Including: ideation, local development, pushing and pulling to github, and hosting static web pages.

## Learning Objectives

<details>
<summary>Priorities: 🥚, 🐣, 🐥, 🐔 (click to learn more)</summary>
<br>

There is a lot to learn in this module. If you can't master all the material
at once, that's expected! Anything you don't master now will always be waiting
for you to review when you need it. These 4 emoji's will help you prioritize
your study time and to measure your progress:

- 🥚: Understanding this material is required, it covers the base skills you'll
  need for this module and the next. You do not need to finish all of them but
  should feel comfortable that you could with enough time.
- 🐣: You have started all of these exercises and feel you could complete them
  all if you just had more time. It may not be easy for you but with effort you
  can make it through.
- 🐥: You have studied the examples and started some exercises if you had time.
  You should have a big-picture understanding of these concepts/skills, but may
  not be confident completing the exercises.
- 🐔: These concepts or skills are not necessary but are related to this module.
  If you are finished with 🥚, 🐣 and 🐥 you can use the 🐔 exercises to push
  yourself without getting distracted from the module's main objectives.

- **GitHub**:
  - [ ] 🥚 **Creating Issues**: You can create a new issue in a GitHub repository using an issue template. You can correctly use labels, milestones, and assignment to make your issue findable.
  - [ ] 🥚 **Searching Issues**: You can find issues in a repository by label, author, and milestone.
  - [ ] 🥚 **Project Boards**: You can use issues on a GitHub project board to track your class assignments and help your classmates when they need it.
- **HYF Workflows**:
  - [ ] 🥚 **Check-Ins**: You can use the `check-in` template to track your module learning objectives, your weekly progress (and to post a retrospective at the end of the module). You create one check-in issue per module in the class repo and each Thursday you add a check-in comment to it and the label for the corresponding week. After review, we add the checked label. No need to remove previous labels either. So as an example, after a 5 week module, you would have 5 comments and 5 labels added by you.
  - [ ] 🥚 **Deliverables**: You can create an issue for this module's `deliverable` and track your progress on the class project board. Each week, there are different assignments / deliverables. If it is an individual project, you create your own deliverable issue for it in the class repo. If it is a group project, the entire group creates 1 issue together in the class repo.
  - [ ] 🥚 **Asking for Help**: You can use the `help-wanted` template in your class repository's Discussion board to ask for help, and to help your classmates when they are blocked.
- **Your Computer**:
  - [ ] 🥚 **File System Management**: You can create and organize a new folder in your personal computer for the materials you will study at HYF.
- **Visual Studio Code**:
  - [ ] 🥚 Install and manage extensions
  - [ ] 🥚 Open a folder for editing
  - [ ] 🥚 Create new files/folders inside of the folder
  - [ ] 🥚 Edit files and save changes

## How to HYF

We are a community of people who want to make the web a better place.

You can expect a growing network, friendships, Sunday fun, a lot of learnings, hard times getting stuck in code, and satisfaction when you reach your goals.

Take a look through our [Core Values](https://home.hackyourfuture.be/core-values) and [Code of Conduct](https://home.hackyourfuture.be/code-of-conduct) so we can make the web a better place together!

## Deliverables

[Precourse deliverable](./deliverables.md) contains the assignment for this week and the instructions to solve the assignment. Please read it carefully.

## Slack/Discord

> _how we communicate_

Slack/Discord is used to communicate between coaches and students during the week. Each class has their own channel in Discord where you can discuss anything that comes to mind.

We require you to be active on Slack/Discord and ask questions when you get stuck. You are also required to help each other out when one of your peers is stuck. What's the point in asking for help if no one is there to help?!

## Class Repository

> _how we collaborate_

Your class repository is the home base for each module and all assignments at HYF. You will use your class repo to:

- Get to know each other
- Ask for help, and help your classmates
- Find links to all the modules and study references
- Submit check-ins and projects
- Get feedback from coaches
- Share helpful study resources
