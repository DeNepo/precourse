# Create a deliverable issue

You will need to create a new _deliverables_ issue in your class repository and
copy-paste this checklist into it. You can check off the list items as you
complete the tasks, the issue will keep track of your progress:

```markdown

2. [ ] Look through the guides in your class repo
3. [ ] Install softwares
4. [ ] Install VS Code extensions
5. [ ] Organize my computer
6. [ ] GitHub setup

<!-- Welcome to HYF :) -->
```

## 1. Create Your Issue

The first step is to create a Precourse issue in your class repository using the
`deliverable` template and paste in the checklist from up there ðŸ‘†.

As you complete the assignments you can click on the check-box to track your
progress. You and your classmates will be able to see each other's issues, this
is a good thing! HYF is built around collaboration. Feel free to read through
each others' work, ask each other questions, and offer to help if you see
someone is stuck.

NOTE : there are different types of issues: `Deliverable`, `check-in` and normal
`issue`
