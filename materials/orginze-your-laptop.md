# Organize Your Computer

Got your softwares installed? Good news! Now it's time to organize your computer. There will be lots of folders and files coming your way, best to be prepared!

You will be working with many files and folders, it's best to start out organized. Here's some suggestions to start off in the right direction:

-   [ ] Create a new folder in your `Documents` called something like "/hyf".
-   [ ] Inside your new "/hyf", create one folder called "/notes" or something like this
    -   You can use this folder to organize your notes in one place
    -   Try using Markdown for your notes!
    -   Looking to share everything you've learned? You can also push your notes to a Github repo ;\)
-   [ ] Inside your new "/hyf", create a folder for the Precourse called "/00-precourse" \(or something similar\)

When you're done your computer's folders should be organized something like this:

```markdown
-/Documents
|-/hack-my-future
|-/01-precourse
| |-/ice-breaker (your ice-breaker repository)
| |-/precourse (the cloned module repo)
| |-/username (your github profile readme repo)
| ...
|-/notes
|-/flashcards
```
