## 1. Create Your Issue

The first step is to create a Precourse issue in your class repository using the `deliverable` template and paste in the checklist from up there ðŸ‘†.

As you complete the assignments you can click on the check-box to track your progress. You and your classmates will be able to see each other's issues, this is a good thing! HYF is built around collaboration. Feel free to read through each others' work, ask each other questions, and offer to help if you see someone is stuck.

## 2. Install Software

Before getting to work you will need to make sure your computer is ready to go. In the _Software Installations_ and _VSCode Extensions_ sections of your `precourse` issue is a list of the softwares you will need to succeed at HYF.

## 5. Organize Your Computer

Got your softwares installed? Good news! Now it's time to organize your computer. There will be lots of folders and files coming your way, best to be prepared!

You will be working with many files and folders, it's best to start out organized. Here's some suggestions to start off in the right direction:

- [ ] Create a new folder in your `Documents` called something like "/hack-my-future".
- [ ] Inside your new "/hack-my-future", create one folder called "/notes" or something like this
  - You can use this folder to organize your notes in one place
  - Try using Markdown for your notes!
  - Looking to share everything you've learned? You can also push your notes to a GitHub repo ;\)
- [ ] Inside your new "/hack-my-future", create a folder for the Precourse called "/00-precourse" \(or something similar\)

When you're done your computer's folders should be organized something like this:

```markdown
-/Documents
|-/hack-my-future
|-/01-precourse
| |-/ice-breaker (your ice-breaker repository)
| |-/precourse (the cloned module repo)
| |-/username (your github profile readme repo)
| ...
|-/notes
|-/flashcards
```
