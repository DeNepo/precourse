this is a first-draft todo list
  there may be "chapters" missing, it's not on purpose
  there are definitely workflows missing in each chapter

about the videos
  think of these as little references when a student is blocked, not where they go to learn a concept
  you are showing how to do a basic workflow on your computer
    these aren't full tutorials explaining everything
    think of them more as maps to find your way around all the applications and buttons
  no longer than 4-5 minutes, 1 minute is ok too
    better to be short with a clear focus so it can be given a good title
  .mp4 because it's lightweight and well-supported
